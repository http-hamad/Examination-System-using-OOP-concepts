## Introduction

The Examination System project embraces Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, providing a modular and scalable structure. This design ensures the codebase is easy to understand, maintain, and extend, facilitating efficient examination processes.

## Basic Features

### Object-Oriented Architecture

The project leverages OOP concepts, offering a modular and scalable architecture that enhances code readability, maintainability, and extensibility.

### User-Friendly Interface

Enjoy an intuitive and user-friendly interface accessible to administrators, instructors, and students. Navigate effortlessly, providing a smooth experience for all stakeholders.

### User Roles

Implementing OOP principles, the system supports different user roles, such as administrators, instructors, and students. Each role has specific functionalities and permissions tailored to their needs.

### Question Bank Management

Effortlessly manage a pool of questions for various subjects and topics. Categorize questions, update content, and ensure a diverse and challenging set of questions for each examination.

### Exam Creation and Scheduling

Administrators can effortlessly create exams, set parameters, and schedule them based on predefined criteria. The system handles scheduling and logistics, reducing administrative overhead.

### Automated Grading

Leverage OOP to implement automated grading mechanisms, ensuring accuracy and efficiency in evaluating exams. The system provides prompt and consistent feedback to students.

### Result Generation

Generate comprehensive and detailed results for each student. The system computes grades, analyzes performance, and provides valuable insights for both students and instructors.

### Security and Authentication

Prioritize the security of the examination process with robust authentication mechanisms. Ensure that only authorized individuals have access to sensitive data and functionalities.

### Logging and Auditing

Keep a detailed log of system activities and user interactions, enhancing accountability, facilitating auditing, and providing a historical record of system events.

### Scalability

The project is designed to be scalable, allowing for easy integration of additional features and modules as the examination system evolves.
